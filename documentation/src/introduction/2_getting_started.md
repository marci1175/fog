# Getting Started

The language can be installed and used fairly easily. You can build the binary for the compiler from the source [available here](https://github.com/marci1175/fog). Additionally, prebuilt installers are available for Windows in the [Github repository](https://github.com/marci1175/fog/releases).

It is best advisable to add the binary to PATH, if compiling the binary manually so that it can be used easily later.

## Uninstalling

The uninstallation of the binary can be achieved using the installer, or deleting the binary manually from the installed folder.
