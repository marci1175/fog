# Getting Started

The language can be installed and used fairly easily. You can build the binary for the compiler from the source [available here](https://github.com/marci1175/fog). Additionally, prebuilt installers are available for Windows in the [Github repository](https://github.com/marci1175/fog/releases).

It is best advisable to add the binary to PATH, if compiling the binary manually so that it can be used easily later.

After installing the compiler we finally get to work on our first ever project!

## Initializing a project

There are multiple commands available for creating a new project.

**You can the commands as following on Windows:**

- For Initializing a project in a pre-existing folder:

```console
$ mkdir /%project-name%
$ cd %project-name%
$ fog init
```

- For creating a new folder specifically for the project:

```console
$ fog new %project-name%
```
