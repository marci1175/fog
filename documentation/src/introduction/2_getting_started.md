# Getting Started

The language can be installed and used fairly easily. You can build the binary for the compiler from the source [available here](https://github.com/marci1175/fog). Additionally, prebuilt installers are available for Windows in the [Github repository](https://github.com/marci1175/fog/releases).

It is best advisable to add the binary to PATH, if compiling the binary manually so that it can be used easily later.

## Initializing a project

There are multiple commands available for creating a new project.

**You can use the commands on Windows as following:**

- For Initializing a project in a pre-existing folder:

```console
$ fog init
Successfully initalized a project at: %project-path%
```

- For creating a new folder specifically for the project:

```console
$ fog new %project-name%
Successfully created project `%project-name%`
```
