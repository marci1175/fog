# The Fog Programming Language

This documentation aims to provide a simple and easy way to understand the basics of the language. Most of the documentation is subject to change as it covers the earliest build of the language.
The documentation is updated per build and assumes you are using the latest build of the compiler.

> The documentation also hosts examples of the code syntax for understandability.

__Translations may be available in the future for multiple languages.__
