# Introduction

Welcome to the Documentation of Fog, the statically typed, simple, flexible language.

## What is Fog for

Fog was primarily created as a way to get experience with creating programming languages, and more importantly the inner workings of [LLVM](https://llvm.org/). It is also extremely useful to create quick programming ideas.
We must also mention that the language is not slow even by modern standards due to its performant backend.

## Who is Fog for

The language is mostly implemented for personal use for now, as I am sure the language does not hold much value for enterprises especially in this state.

## The use of the documentation

The documentation assumes you are using the latest release of the language. It is advisable that you read the documentation from front to back, so that you are familiar with all the concepts the language brings.
